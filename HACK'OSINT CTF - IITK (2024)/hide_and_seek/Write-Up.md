Utilize John to execute a brute-force attack on the password:

```bash
zip2john mystery.zip > zip.hash
john zip.hash --wordlist=rockyou.txt
john --show zip.hash
```
These commands convert the password hash from a ZIP file into a format compatible with John the Ripper and initiate a brute-force attack to retrieve the password. Upon successful cracking, the passwords associated with the hashes stored in `zip.hash` are displayed.

Executing these commands facilitates password retrieval for each file. Upon navigating through directories and examining the enclosed files, a JPEG file containing the flag in hexadecimal format becomes visible: `c3i{well_done_u_got_it}`.
