To proceed with decrypting the file, we will utilize the `rockyou` wordlist for password brute-forcing using tools such as `John The Ripper` and `Fcrackzip`.

Once the password `tcpip` is identified, we can access the image file.
Subsequently, apply `stegseek` to perform another password brute-force attack:
```bash
stegseek flag.jpeg rockyou.txt
```

Following successful extraction, the flag is revealed: `TCP1P{m4st3r1ng_cr4ck1ng_w1th_r0cky0u!!!}`
