After obtaining the file, utilize [Cyberchief](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to extract its contents.

From the extracted data, a `.wav` file is identified.

Next, analyze the `spectrogram` of the `.wav` file to unveil its hidden content.

This process reveals the flag: `TCP1P{4nn0y1ng_f0r3ns1cs_1m4g3_4nd_4ud10!!!}`

This flag was discovered through detailed spectrogram analysis of the `.wav` file.
