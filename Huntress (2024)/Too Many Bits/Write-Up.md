# Too Many Bits

## Description

```
What do all these ones and zeros mean?! We are in the Warmups category after all...
```

Upon starting the challenge, we are presented with a binary string. To decode this string, we use a custom [Python script](Script.py). This script efficiently converts the binary string into a readable format, ultimately revealing the flag.

```plaintext
flag{d01471702a10134cdad1ddde06678f2f}
```

By leveraging this script, we streamline the decoding process, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency in uncovering the hidden flag.
