# Base64by32

## Description

```
This is a dumb challenge. I'm sorry.
```

Upon unzipping the [challenge file](./Files/base64by32.zip), we discover a file that has been repeatedly encoded in Base64. To decode it, we can use the [Python Script](Script.py). After several iterations, we determine the exact number of times the text was encoded.
